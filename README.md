# Zoom Meeting Summarizer
This Python application takes an MP4 file of a Zoom meeting and automates the process of transcribing the speech to text, followed by summarizing the text into concise bullet points. 
It leverages several libraries, including AssemblyAI for speech-to-text conversion, Torch and Transformers for natural language processing, and NLTK for text summarization.

## Features:
Automated Transcription: Converts speech from Zoom meeting recordings into text format using AssemblyAI's speech-to-text API.
Text Summarization: Utilizes Torch and Transformers for natural language processing to condense the transcribed text into bullet point summaries.
Customizable Output: Provides flexibility to adjust summarization parameters and formatting options based on user preferences.
Efficiency and Accuracy: Offers a fast and accurate method for summarizing lengthy meeting discussions into key points, saving time for users.

## How to Use:
Install the required Python libraries: AssemblyAI, Torch, NLTK, Transformers.
Provide the MP4 file of the Zoom meeting as input to the application.
Run the application to automatically transcribe the speech to text and generate summarized bullet points.
Review and refine the generated summary as needed for your meeting notes or documentation.

## Future Enhancements:
Implement support for additional speech-to-text APIs to enhance accuracy and flexibility.
Integrate with cloud storage platforms for seamless access to Zoom meeting recordings.
Explore advanced natural language processing techniques to improve summarization quality and efficiency.
